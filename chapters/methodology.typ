== Ingredients

- Fresh crab (cleaned and cracked)
- Chili sauce (spicy and tangy, just the way Mr. Krabs likes it)
- A hint of seaweed for that oceanic touch
- A touch of love (and maybe a pinch of greed, it's a secret ingredient, after all!)

== Instructions

1. Start by heating up the grill at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs would tell you that the smell of sizzling crab is the sweet scent of money!

2. Place the cleaned and cracked crab pieces on the grill and let them sizzle and pop. Mr. Krabs knows that a little drama goes a long way in the kitchen.

3. Once the crab turns a lovely shade of pink, pour a generous amount of spicy chili sauce over it. Make sure it's hot enough to make even Squidward's nose twitch!

4. Sprinkle a hint of seaweed for that oceanic flair. It's the secret ingredient that ties everything together.

5. Toss the crab in the chili sauce until it's fully coated and let it simmer for a few minutes. Mr. Krabs would say, "Time is money, so don't let it overcook!"

6. Enjoy your meal! And remember, Mr. Krabs would always remind you to keep an eye on your wallet. After all, he's a businessman at heart!
